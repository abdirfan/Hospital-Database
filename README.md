Project Title: Hospital Database Management System

Overview:
Our team collaborated on developing a Hospital Database Management System as part of our databases class project. The system is designed to efficiently manage patient records, physician instructions, nurse assignments, medication administration, and financial transactions within a hospital environment.

Features:

Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):

Developed a comprehensive ERD to model the relationships between entities such as patients, physicians, nurses, rooms, medications, and health records.
Schema Design:

Designed relational database schemas for various entities including Patient, Physician, Nurse, Room, Health_Record, Instruction, Medication, Invoice, and Payment.
Implemented foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity and enforce referential integrity.
SQL Views:

Created SQL views to provide simplified and customized perspectives of the data, such as room occupancy status, nurse-patient workload summary, and patient medication usage.
Triggers:

Implemented triggers to automate tasks such as updating room capacity upon patient admission, adjusting invoice balances upon payment, and updating room fees in invoices upon changes.
Queries:

Developed complex SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the database, including patient-physician relationships, high-fee instructions, and patient diagnosis details.
Transactions:

Designed transactions to handle critical operations such as updating patient room assignments and marking patient health records as treated upon recovery.
Documentation:

Prepared detailed documentation including assumptions, ERD diagrams, entity attributes, relationships, views, triggers, queries, and transactions for comprehensive understanding and future reference.
Collaboration:

Collaborated effectively with team members, dividing tasks based on expertise and coordinating efforts to ensure timely completion of project milestones.
Conclusion:
Our Hospital Database Management System project demonstrates our proficiency in database design, SQL programming, and teamwork. It provides a solid foundation for managing hospital data efficiently, ensuring data integrity, and facilitating informed decision-making processes.
